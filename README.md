# rhododendron
Just a C-like compiler for fun
(Rewritten in Rust in one night :P)

Todo:
- [x] Lexing
- [x] Parsing to AST
- [x] Code Generation
- [ ] Support for functions and gotos

This will include non-C features such as
- Built-in Tuple Packing and Unpacking

As well as not every feature C has.

The big question is whether or not I'll write a linker(yes).
